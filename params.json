You can opt to run each element of the flow separately in a more efficient manner on a farm environment by adding only the ``-p`` and ``-i`` options.\r\n\r\nPlease see ``pindel -h`` or ``pindel.pl -m`` for the most up-to-date usage information.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n###Dependencies/Install\r\n\r\nPlease install the following first:\r\n\r\n* [PCAP-core](http://github.com/ICGC-TCGA-PanCancer/PCAP-core/releases)\r\n* [cgpVcf](http://github.com/cancerit/cgpVcf/releases)\r\n\r\nPlease see these for any child dependencies.\r\n\r\nOnce complete please run:\r\n\r\n./setup.sh /some/install/location\r\n\r\nPlease be aware that this expects basic C compilation libraries and tools to be available,\r\nmost are listed in `INSTALL`.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nLICENCE\r\n=======\r\n\r\nCopyright (c) 2014 Genome Research Ltd.\r\n\r\nAuthor: Cancer Genome Project <cgpit@sanger.ac.uk>\r\n\r\nThis file is part of cgpPindel.\r\n\r\ncgpPindel is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify it under\r\nthe terms of the GNU Affero General Public License as published by the Free\r\nSoftware Foundation; either version 3 of the License, or (at your option) any\r\nlater version.\r\n\r\nThis program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT\r\nANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS\r\nFOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
