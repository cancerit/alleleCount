# alleleCount

The alleleCount package primarily exists to prevent code duplication between some other projects,
specifically AscatNGS and Battenburg.

| [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/cancerit/alleleCount.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/cancerit/alleleCount) | [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/cancerit/alleleCount.svg?branch=dev)](https://travis-ci.org/cancerit/alleleCount) |

The project contains 2 equivalent implementations of allele counting code in perl and C for BAM/CRAM processing.

## Loci File

The input for both tools is a simple tab formatted file of chromosome and 1-based positions, e.g.

```
<CHR><TAB><POS1>
<CHR><TAB><POS2>
<CHR><TAB><POS3>
...
```

The file doesn't need to be in any particular order (although disk reads are likely to be more efficient when sorted).

### Dependencies/Install

Some of the code included in this package has dependencies:

* [samtools v1.2+](https://github.com/samtools/samtools)
* [htslib](https://github.com/samtools/htslib)

And various utility perl modules.

These are all installed for you by running:

    ./setup.sh /some/install/location

Please be aware that this expects basic C compilation libraries and tools to be available.
